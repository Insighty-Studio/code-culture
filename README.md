# Insighty Code Culture
Our Code Culture is based on the ideas of Martin Fowler, Uncle Bob, Eric Evans, Kent Beck and other legends of coding. We believe that:
>Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.

as well as:
>The real problem is that programmers have spent far too much time worrying about efficiency in the wrong places and at the wrong times; premature optimization is the root of all evil (or at least most of it) in programming.
